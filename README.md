# bmi210 Final Project

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) has been developed by the NIMH for classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and measurable neurobiology.  The goal, to serve as a research focused and more objective ontology as compared to the DSM. There is no existing ontology to organize the published literature according to the RDoC framework. Here we address that need by developing an RDoC ontology for classifying abstracts published on PubMed that relate to and inform the RDoC framework.
